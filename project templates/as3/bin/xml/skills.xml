			<![CDATA[I started developing for the Adobe Flash platform back in 1999. I have strong AS3, AS2, AS1, and Adobe AIR skills. I produce reusable object-oriented code. I use MVC and other design patterns. I've been using FlashDevelop to code and I love it. I have only medium experience with the Flex Framework because I love pure ActionScript.

In my development I use tools such as AMF, PHP, SWFAddress, SVN, XML, SQLite, and UML. I like frameworks such as PureMVC or Gaia, but whenever possible I use my own framework, it rocks :)

Iâ€™m particularly renown for my skills in front-end animation, interaction and UX.

I have the power to create engaging Flash experiences using 3D, Physics, visual effects, dynamic sound, artificial intelligence, multiple languages, integration with hardware like phidgets, lasers, serial ports, etc.]]>
